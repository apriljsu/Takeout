# Takeout
## Background
Have you ever had a day when you are struggling to figure out what you want for your seamless order? That happens to me at least once a week. So why not having a place to store all your favorite take-out/delivery restaurants so it will give you some inspiration on the days when you really need them!
## About This App
Takeout(https://express-takeout.herokuapp.com/) is the solution I came up with. It listed all your favorite restaurants by cusine. You can cick on any restaurant to see your own rating and favorite dish. You can also add/edit/delete any of the restaurant to keep your list most updated.
## Technologies Used
Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS

Here is a sneak peek of the app.
